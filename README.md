So I'm attempting to create a replica of the RobCo terminals from Fallout 3.
The emulator will be made as close as possible to the terminals in-game, and then some.

The user must actually type each command, instead of the program "typing" for the user.

This program is still in its infancy at the moment, but I intend to add in the following features:
	- The actual "Hacking" mini-game.
		- Five difficulty levels, one of which is randomly
		  chosen on loading the hacking game.
			- Very Easy: four to five letter words
			- Easy: six to eight letter words
			- Average: nine to ten letter words
			- Hard: eleven to twelve letter words
			- Very Hard: thirteen to fifteen letter words
		- A large list of words with similar spelling which
		  the game calls depending on the difficulty level.
		- The game will then pull sixteen random words from
		  said list, and display them amidst a whole bunch of
		  crap. You know the game, don't you? You wouldn't be
		  here otherwise.
	- Once the hacking game is successfully completed the user
	  is then presented with options based on in-game terminals.
		- Operation manuals.
		- Dr Braun's personal logs.
		- Information about the G.E.C.K.
		- etc. (If you have a suggestion for something to 
		  include, please let me know!)

Commands:

SET TERMINAL/INQUIRE

SET FILE/PROTECTION=OWNER:RWED ACCOUNTS.F

SET HALT RESTART/MAINT

RUN DEBUG/ACCOUNTS.F

Updates will be sporadic as this is an early C project of mine so I will only be making as much as I can as I learn the skills.

Thanks for checking out this program of mine!
